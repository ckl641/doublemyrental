## Target: High earners ($500K+), doctors, lawyers, tech execs, dentists

### Post 1
I lost my business in 2017. Listed my rental on Airbnb out of desperation.

9 months later: 30 units. $2.4M/year.

Today I manage $100M+ in short-term rental properties across 16 states. Forbes featured my story.

But here's what I've learned: the people who build the most wealth aren't the ones with the most money. They're the ones who deploy it strategically.

If you're earning $500K+ and watching 35% disappear to the IRS every year, there's a better way.

Short-term rental properties generate cash flow AND tax deductions. One client saved $140K in taxes Year 1 — while collecting $90K in rental income.

That's not theory. That's math.

DM me "TAX" if you want to see the numbers for your situation.

$81,000 invested → $40,900/year in cash flow.

That's a 50.5% cash-on-cash return.

Here's the breakdown:

Property: 4BR/3BA, pool + game room
Purchase: $650K (10% down)
Setup: $16K (game room + contractors)
Revenue: $130K/year
Expenses: $89K/year
Net: $40.9K/year

Plus $72K in Year 1 tax savings through depreciation.

Total Year 1 return: $112,900 on $81K invested = 139%.

This isn't a unicorn deal. This is what proper STR investing looks like when you:
1. Use data to find 20%+ yield properties
2. Build differentiated experiences (not cookie-cutter rentals)
3. Optimize for max dollars during peak demand

I do free strategy calls for qualified investors. No pitch — just math.

Your CPA is costing you $50K-$100K per year.

Not in fees. In missed deductions.

Most CPAs don't understand short-term rental tax strategy. They don't know about:

→ Bonus depreciation on STR improvements
→ Cost segregation studies (accelerating 27.5 years into Year 1)
→ Material participation rules that let STR losses offset W-2 income
→ The STR loophole that most "real estate professionals" miss

One dental couple I work with: $800K combined income. Were paying $280K in taxes.

After 2 STR properties: tax bill dropped by $140K. Plus $90K/year in new passive income.

The $40K they invested in setup? Returned 350% in Year 1 through tax savings alone.

If you're earning $500K+ and not using STR tax strategy, you're leaving money on the table.

I charge $3,000-$4,000 per night.

Not per week. Per NIGHT.

Everyone told me I was crazy. "Nobody pays that for an Airbnb."

They were wrong.

Our best month: $24,000 from a single property.

The secret? We don't sell rooms. We sell experiences.

→ Glow-in-the-dark game rooms
→ Resort-style pools and hot tubs
→ Custom-built paintball courses
→ One-of-a-kind themed suites

When your property is the only one of its kind in the market, YOU set the price.

Most hosts race to the bottom on price. We race to the top on value.

That's the difference between a $50K/year Airbnb and a $130K/year STR business.

"But what about the recession?"

I've been through it. COVID hit when my son was 5 months old.

Here's what happened:
- Pivoted to long-term rentals for stranded travelers
- Helped landlords get loan modifications
- Kept every property cash-flow positive

After COVID? Revenue doubled. Demand for unique properties exploded.

Here's the thing about real estate: people always need places to stay. And premium experiences are recession-resistant — luxury travelers are the last to cut spending.

In 2008-2009, high-end hotels barely dipped. Budget hotels got crushed.

Same principle applies to STRs. Average listings suffer. Premium properties thrive.

That's why every property we build is designed to be the only one of its kind.
