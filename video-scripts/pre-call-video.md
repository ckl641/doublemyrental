## SCRIPT

**[INTRO — 15 seconds]**

Hey — if you're watching this, you've got a strategy call coming up with me. I'm Chi Ta.

I wanted to give you a quick heads-up on what to expect so we can make the most of our time together.

**[CREDIBILITY — 30 seconds]**

Quick background — I've been in real estate about 20 years. I manage over $100 million in short-term rental properties across 16 states. Forbes wrote about my story. And I went from completely broke in 2017 to building one of the most profitable Airbnb portfolios in the country.

But here's what actually matters to you: almost every single client I work with buys a second property. Not because I'm a good salesman — because the numbers speak for themselves.

**[WHAT TO EXPECT — 45 seconds]**

On our call, I'm going to ask you a few questions:
- What's your annual income?
- How much are you currently paying in taxes?
- Do you have capital available for a down payment?
- What's your timeline?

No wrong answers. I just need to understand your situation so I can tell you honestly whether this makes sense for you.

Then I'll walk you through the math on a real deal. Not hypotheticals — a real property, real numbers, real returns. Usually something like a $650K home that generates $130K a year in revenue with a 50% cash-on-cash return.

**[THE REAL VALUE — 30 seconds]**

Here's what most people don't realize until the call: the biggest win isn't the cash flow. It's the tax savings.

Most of my clients are earning $500K or more. They're writing massive checks to the IRS. With bonus depreciation and cost segregation, we can offset $50,000 to $150,000 in taxes — in year one. That alone pays for my entire fee.

**[CLOSE — 20 seconds]**

So come prepared with your questions. Be honest about your numbers. And I'll be honest about whether this is the right fit.

If it's not, I'll tell you. If it is — I'll show you exactly what we'd build together.

See you on the call.
