Every year, high earners hand the IRS 200, 300, sometimes 400 thousand dollars. And every year, that money disappears.

But there's a group of doctors, attorneys, and executives who stopped doing that. They took that same money — the money they were giving away — and put it into short-term rental properties that pay them back every single month.

I'm Chi Ta. Over the last 20 years, I've helped my clients build over 100 million dollars in Airbnb properties across 16 states. Forbes wrote about it. But here's what actually matters.

We find the property. We negotiate the deal. We handle the loan. We design it, build it, furnish it, and manage it 24/7, 365. You don't lift a finger.

Our average client puts in 81 thousand dollars and gets back 130 thousand a year in revenue — plus 70 thousand in tax savings in year one alone.

Same money you're giving the IRS right now could be building you a portfolio that cash flows, appreciates, and eliminates your tax bill permanently.

We take five to ten new clients a month. That's it. If you're earning 500 thousand or more and you're tired of funding the government instead of your future — this is your invitation.
