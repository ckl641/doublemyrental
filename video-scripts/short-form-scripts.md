### Script 1: "How $81K Becomes $130K/Year"
**Hook:** "I turned $81,000 into $130K per year. Here's the deal breakdown."

**Content:**
"$650K property. Put 10% down — $65K. Added a $10K game room and $6K in contractor work. Total cash in: $81,000.

Revenue: $130K a year. After ALL expenses — mortgage, management, cleaning, utilities — I net $40,900. That's a 50.5% cash-on-cash return.

But here's the kicker — the tax savings in Year 1 were $72,000. So the total return? $112,900 on $81K invested. That's 139%.

Your savings account pays what... 4%?"

**CTA:** "Link in bio if you want to see the math for your situation."

**Visual:** B-roll of the Desert Retreat property, drone shots, game room, before/after

### Script 2: "I Charge $4,000 a Night"
**Hook:** "They told me nobody pays $4,000 a night for an Airbnb."

**Content:**
"They were wrong. One property made $24,000 in a single month.

Here's the secret — I don't rent rooms. I sell experiences.

[Show game room] Glow-in-the-dark game rooms.
[Show pool] Resort-style pools.
[Show interior] One-of-a-kind design.

When your property is the ONLY one of its kind, you set the price. Everyone else races to the bottom. We race to the top."

**CTA:** "Follow for more real estate math."

### Script 3: "Your CPA Is Costing You $100K"
**Hook:** "If you make $500K+ a year, your CPA is probably costing you $100,000."

**Content:**
"Not in fees. In missed deductions.

Most CPAs don't understand STR tax strategy.

Bonus depreciation. Cost segregation. Material participation. The STR loophole.

One couple I work with — both dentists, $800K combined. They were paying $280K in taxes.

After two STR properties? Tax bill dropped $140K. PLUS $90K a year in new passive income.

The $40K they invested? Returned 350% Year 1 in tax savings alone."

**CTA:** "DM me 'TAX' if you want the breakdown."

### Script 4: "Before and After" (Neon Paradise)
**Hook:** "We bought this house for $385K. Watch what we did to it."

**Content:**
[Show before photos] "Standard 5-bed, 2-bath. Beige walls. Nothing special."

[Transition to after] "Kitchen remodel: $8K. Furniture and design: $40K."

[Show game room] "And then... the glow-in-the-dark game room."

[Show revenue] "Revenue: $120K a year. Cash flow: $44K. Cash-on-cash return: 47%.

On a $385K house. With $94K total invested."

**CTA:** "This is what we do. Link in bio."

### Script 5: "The $0 Down Deal"
**Hook:** "My first deal: $0 down."

**Content:**
"Owner financed 40%. Hard money covered 60%. Zero out of pocket.

Net cash flow: $2,000 a month from day one.

That was the deal that changed my life. I went from losing my business in 2017 to 30 units and $2.4 million a year in 9 months.

Today I manage over $100 million in short-term rental properties.

And I guarantee — GUARANTEE — 15% minimum yield. Or I manage your property for free."

**CTA:** "Follow for more deals like this."

### Script 6: "Rich People Don't Pay Taxes (Legally)"
**Hook:** "Wanna know why rich people pay less in taxes than you? Short-term rentals."

**Content:**
"Here's the legal loophole:

Step 1: Buy an STR property
Step 2: Cost segregation study — accelerates 27 years of depreciation into Year 1
Step 3: Material participation — you're 'active' so losses offset your W-2

Result: $50K-$100K wiped off your tax bill. Year one.

AND you own an asset. That cash flows. That appreciates. That builds generational wealth.

The IRS doesn't want you to know this. Your CPA doesn't understand it. But every wealthy real estate investor uses it."

**CTA:** "Save this. Share it with someone who needs it."

### Script 7: "Forbes Featured Me"
**Hook:** "Forbes called me an 'Airbnb Millionaire.' But that's not the real story."

**Content:**
"The real story? I'm a Vietnamese immigrant who lost everything in 2017.

Listed my rental on Airbnb out of desperation. Made more than the long-term rent in month one.

9 months later: 30 units. $2.4 million a year.

Today: $100M+ managed. 16 states. Times Square billboard. Forbes feature.

But what I'm most proud of? Almost every client buys a second property. Because the math works."

**CTA:** "Link in bio to see if you qualify."

### Script 8: "5 Properties That Make $600K/Year"
**Hook:** "Five properties. $600K per year. Here's each one."

**Content:**
"Property 1: Desert Retreat. 4BR, pool, game room. $130K/year.
Property 2: Luxury Oasis. 3BR, 3,088 sqft. $150K/year.
Property 3: Family Estate. 5BR transformation. $120K/year.
Property 4: Neon Paradise. Glow-in-the-dark game room. $120K/year.

Total: $520K/year from 4 properties. With a 5th, we'll break $600K.

Combined cash invested: under $400K. Annual return: over 100%.

This is the power of premium STRs with unique experiences."

**CTA:** "Want your own portfolio? Link in bio."
