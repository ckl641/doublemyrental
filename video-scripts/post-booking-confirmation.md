Hey — Chi Ta here. Your session is locked in, and I'm looking forward to it.

I want to make sure we don't waste a single minute, so let me tell you exactly what's going to happen.

I'm going to pull up a real property — not a slide deck, not a hypothetical. A real home that's generating income right now. I'll break down the exact purchase price, what it cost to set up, what it brings in every month, and what it nets after all expenses.

Then we're going to run your numbers. Based on your income and your tax situation, I'll show you exactly how much you could offset in year one. For most of my clients, that number is somewhere between 70 and 150 thousand dollars. When people see their number for the first time, the whole conversation changes.

After that, I'll walk you through how we build and manage the entire thing for you. From finding the home to negotiating the deal, to setting up the loan, to designing and furnishing the property, to managing it 24/7. You'll see exactly what the process looks like and how quickly we move. Most of our clients have paying guests within two weeks of closing.

Here's what I need you to come prepared with. Three numbers. Your approximate annual income. Roughly what you paid in taxes last year. And how much capital you could put toward a down payment. You don't need documents — just a general idea. The more accurate you are, the more specific I can make this for you.

Last thing. I keep these sessions limited because I want to give you my full attention. If something comes up and you can't make it, let me know so I can open the slot for someone on the waitlist. But if you can be there — be there. This is going to be the most valuable hour you spend this month.

Talk soon.
