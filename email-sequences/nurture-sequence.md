# DMR Email Nurture Sequence — 7 Emails

## Email 1: Welcome + Case Study (Day 0)
**Subject:** Your free case study: $650K property → $40K/yr passive income
**From:** Chi Ta <chi@doublemyrental.com>

---

Hey {{first_name}},

Thanks for checking out Double My Rental. Here's the case study I promised.

**Quick version:** We bought a $650K property with $81K total cash in. It now generates $130K/year in revenue and $40.9K/year in net cash flow. That's a 50.5% cash-on-cash return.

[Download the full case study →](link)

But the real story isn't just the cash flow — it's the $72K in Year 1 tax savings our client got through bonus depreciation and cost segregation. That $40K setup fee? It paid for itself in tax savings alone.

If you're earning $500K+ and tired of writing checks to the IRS, I built this service for you.

More coming this week.

## Email 2: The Tax Angle (Day 2)
**Subject:** Your CPA won't tell you this about short-term rentals

---

{{first_name}},

Here's something most high earners don't realize:

**A short-term rental property can offset $50K-$100K+ in taxes** — in Year 1.

Here's how it works:
- Bonus depreciation lets you write off the entire property improvement in Year 1
- Cost segregation accelerates depreciation on fixtures, appliances, and finishes
- If you materially participate (we handle this), STR losses offset your W-2 income

One of our clients — a dental couple earning $800K/year — were paying $280K in taxes. We set them up with two properties. Their tax bill dropped by $140K.

They didn't just save money. They now own two assets generating $45K/year each in cash flow, appreciating 8% annually.

**The money you'd send to the IRS instead builds equity, cash flow, and generational wealth.**

That's not theory. That's what we do, and we guarantee 15% minimum yield — or we manage your property for free.

## Email 3: The Deal Math (Day 4)
**Subject:** How $81K turns into $120K/year (real numbers, real property)

---

{{first_name}},

Let me break down an actual deal for you. No theory — just math.

**The Property:** 4BR/3BA with pool and game room
**Purchase Price:** $650,000
**Down Payment (10%):** $65,000
**Game Room Setup:** $10,000
**Contractor Costs:** $6,000
**Total Cash In: $81,000**

**Annual Revenue:** $130,000
**Annual Expenses:** $89,100
- Mortgage (PITI): $36,000
- Management (15%): $19,500
- Cleaning: $18,000
- Utilities: $9,600
- Pool/Landscaping: $3,600
- Supplies + Maintenance: $2,400

**Net Cash Flow: $40,900/year**
**Cash-on-Cash Return: 50.5%**
**Year 1 Tax Savings: ~$72,000**

That means in Year 1, our client's total return was **$112,900 on $81,000 invested. That's a 139% return.**

By year 5? The property appreciated to $955K. That's $305K in equity + $200K in cumulative cash flow.

We find these deals every week. Our proprietary system scans every home for sale and filters for 20%+ yield. Out of 300-500 properties per day, only 4 qualify.

## Email 4: Origin Story + Trust (Day 7)
**Subject:** I lost everything in 2017. Here's what I did next.

---

{{first_name}},

In 2017, the reverse mortgage industry collapsed. I lost my business overnight.

I had one rental property. Out of desperation, I listed it on Airbnb. That first month, I made more than the long-term rent.

9 months later: 30 units. $2.4 million/year. The San Francisco Bay Area, 2018.

Then COVID hit. My son was 5 months old. I pivoted — helped landlords get loan modifications, rented to stranded travelers long-term. We survived.

Today I manage $100M+ in STR properties across 16 states. Forbes featured my story. I've helped clients build portfolios worth $30M+.

But here's what I'm most proud of: **almost every client buys a second property.** They see the numbers, they feel the cash flow, and they come back.

I don't sell courses. I don't sell dreams. I find, build, and manage properties that make money — and I guarantee it.

If we don't hit 15% yield, I manage your property for free.

## Email 5: Social Proof (Day 10)
**Subject:** "When can we get another property?"

---

{{first_name}},

That's the most common thing our clients say.

Not "How's it going?" or "Is this working?" — they already know. The cash flow hits their account every month.

**They ask: "When can we get another one?"**

Here's what some of them have built:
- A surgeon in Texas: 3 properties, $180K/year net income
- A dental couple in California: 2 properties, $90K/year + $140K tax savings
- A tech exec in Washington: Started with 1, now owns 4 generating $200K/year

Our biggest client has a 60-home portfolio with a $30M budget. He started with one property too.

The difference between them and everyone else? They took the call.

20-30% of people who get on a strategy call with me end up working together. Not because I'm a great salesman — because the math sells itself.

## Email 6: Urgency + Scarcity (Day 14)
**Subject:** We're taking 5 new clients this month

---

{{first_name}},

Quick update: we can take 5-10 new clients this month.

Not 50. Not 100. Five to ten.

Every property we build gets the full treatment:
- Proprietary market analysis (300-500 homes scanned → 4 qualify)
- Custom negotiation on purchase price
- Full design, remodel, and furnishing
- Game rooms, resort amenities, one-of-a-kind experiences
- 24/7/365 management — guests, maintenance, cleaning, everything

That takes time. We're not a franchise. We don't cut corners. Each property is built to generate maximum revenue from day one.

**Current waitlist: ~3 months.** Earlier you apply, earlier you start.

Our fee is $40K — split $20K at sourcing, $20K at setup. Sounds like a lot? Consider:
- $50K-$100K in Year 1 tax savings (offsets the fee entirely)
- $40K+ in annual cash flow
- 8% annual appreciation on a $500K-$1M asset

The fee pays for itself before your first guest checks in.
