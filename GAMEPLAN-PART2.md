**Day 20 (Sat) — Reel/TikTok**

### EMAIL 1 — Immediate (Welcome + Hook)

**Subject:** The STR tax strategy your CPA won't tell you about

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

Thanks for reaching out. I'm going to keep this short because I respect your time.

Here's the deal:

If you earn $500K+ and you're paying a massive tax bill every year, there's a legal strategy that could save you $200K-$400K in year one.

It involves buying a short-term rental property, running a cost segregation study, and using 100% bonus depreciation to write off the property against your W-2 income.

I've done this 30 times. I manage 30 units. 4.95 stars. $2.4M/year in revenue across my portfolio.

My best deal? A $650K home that generated $24K in its first month. $3,000-$4,000 a night during peak events.

And the entire purchase price was written off in year one.

I don't teach courses. I don't sell PDFs. I do it FOR you — end to end.

If you want to see how this works for your specific tax situation, book a 60-minute strategy call with me:

👉 https://calendly.com/chitabnb/60min

Fair warning: I only take 5-10 new homes per month and there's currently a 3-month waitlist. But the call is free and I'll walk you through the exact numbers.

Talk soon,

### EMAIL 2 — Day 2 (Origin Story)

**Subject:** I lost my entire business in 2017

**Body:**

[First Name],

In 2017, I lost my reverse mortgage business. Completely.

New regulations. Market shift. Gone.

I had a rental property sitting there doing nothing. Out of desperation, I listed it on Airbnb.

First month: way more than I expected.

So I did it again. And again. I studied everything — pricing algorithms, guest psychology, interior design, listing optimization, market analysis.

Within 9 months, I had 30 units generating $2.4M/year.

Then COVID hit. While most landlords panicked, I helped them get loan modifications. I rented my properties to stranded travelers who had nowhere to go.

That crisis made me better. Every crisis has.

Now I have a proprietary app that scans 300-500 homes every single day. Out of those, only about 4 qualify for my clients. That's how selective we are.

I'm telling you this because I want you to know who you'd be working with. Not some guru who read a book. Someone who's been through the fire — multiple times — and built something real on the other side.

If you're ready to talk about building your own STR portfolio, here's my calendar:

### EMAIL 3 — Day 4 (The Math)

**Subject:** Let me show you the exact math on a $400K property

**Body:**

[First Name],

I know you're analytical. So let me give you real numbers.

**Example: $400K Property in a High-Demand STR Market**

- Purchase price: $400,000
- Setup + furnishing: $40,000 (my full-service fee)
- Cost segregation study: ~$5,000
- Total investment: ~$445,000

**Year 1 Tax Impact:**
- Bonus depreciation (100%): ~$280,000 deduction
- If your marginal tax rate is 37%: That's ~$103,000 in tax savings
- Your net out-of-pocket after tax savings: ~$342,000

**Year 1 Revenue (Conservative):**
- Average nightly rate: $250
- Occupancy: 70%
- Gross revenue: ~$64,000
- After expenses (30%): ~$44,800 net

**Your Real Year-1 Cost:**
Total investment ($445K) - Tax savings ($103K) - Net revenue ($44.8K) = **$297,200** for a property worth $400K+ that cash flows every month going forward.

You bought a $400K asset for ~$297K in real dollars. And it pays you every month after that.

This is why my clients don't blink at the $40K fee. It's not a cost. It's the catalyst for the entire tax strategy.

Want me to run these numbers for YOUR income and YOUR target market?

P.S. — My biggest client has a 60-home portfolio and a $30M budget. He didn't start with 60 homes. He started with one call.

### EMAIL 4 — Day 6 (Case Study)

**Subject:** $310K cabin → $15K in 10 days (real numbers)

**Body:**

[First Name],

Quick case study for you.

One of my clients bought a cabin in the Poconos. Purchase price: $310,000.

We did our thing — full setup, professional furnishing, listing optimization, dynamic pricing, the works.

**$15,000 in revenue in the first 10 days.**

Not the first month. The first 10 DAYS.

That's a run rate that would pay back the entire setup fee in under a month.

Here's what made this work:

1. **Market selection.** Our app identified this area as high-demand with low supply for the specific configuration we wanted.
2. **Property optimization.** We didn't just furnish it. We designed it for the algorithm — the photos, the amenities, the description, the pricing.
3. **Launch strategy.** We don't just "list it and hope." We have a launch protocol that gets bookings in the first 48 hours.

This is what full-service means. You buy the property. I build the business.

### EMAIL 5 — Day 8 (Objection: "I can do this myself")

**Subject:** You could do this yourself. Here's why you won't.

**Body:**

[First Name],

I'll be honest with you.

Everything I do, you could technically do yourself. Buy a property. Furnish it. List it on Airbnb. Figure out pricing. Handle guests. Manage cleaners.

But here's what actually happens when people "do it themselves":

❌ They pick the wrong market (no data, just vibes)
❌ They buy the wrong property (good house ≠ good STR)
❌ They furnish it cheap (guests notice, reviews suffer)
❌ They take bad photos (listing gets buried)
❌ They price it wrong (too high = no bookings, too low = leaving money on the table)
❌ They get a 4.2 rating (algorithm death sentence)
❌ They don't do a cost seg study (miss $200K+ in deductions)

Six months later, they're making $2K/month on a property that should be making $8K/month. And they've spent 15 hours a week on it.

My clients make more, work less, and save a fortune in taxes.

4.95 stars across 30 units isn't an accident. It's 20 years of knowing exactly what works.

Your call. But if you'd rather skip the learning curve:

### EMAIL 6 — Day 10 (Social Proof Dump)

**Subject:** What my clients say (I'll let them talk)

**Body:**

[First Name],

I could keep telling you how good this is. But let me step aside and let my clients speak:

---

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"Chi found us a property we never would have found on our own. His app identified it before it even hit the mainstream sites. We were cash-flow positive in month two."*

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"I'm a surgeon. I don't have time to manage rentals. Chi handles literally everything. I just see the deposits hit my account."*

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"The tax savings alone paid for Chi's fee three times over. My CPA was blown away by the cost seg study results."*

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ *"We started with one property. We're now on our fourth with Chi. The man just delivers."*

---

4.95 stars. 30 units. 20 years in the game.

I don't need to convince you. I just need you to get on a call so I can show you the math for YOUR situation.

### EMAIL 7 — Day 12 (The "Why $40K" Email)

**Subject:** Why I charge $40K (and why my clients thank me for it)

**Body:**

[First Name],

Let's address the elephant.

$40K is a lot of money. I know. I'm not going to pretend it isn't.

But here's what $40K actually is in the context of what we do:

**$40K is:**
- The setup fee for a full-service STR business
- The cost of having a 20-year veteran source, negotiate, renovate, furnish, photograph, list, price, and launch your property
- The trigger for a tax strategy that saves you $100K-$400K+ in year one

**$40K is NOT:**
- A course
- A PDF
- A coaching program
- A "figure it out yourself" situation

**The ROI math:**
- Average first-year tax savings: $100K-$250K
- Average first-year revenue: $50K-$100K+
- $40K fee → $150K-$350K in total first-year value
- That's a 3.75x to 8.75x return

My biggest client — 60 homes, $30M budget — didn't negotiate my fee. He negotiated to get to the FRONT of the waitlist.

When people see the numbers, the fee isn't the question. The question is: "How fast can we start?"

### EMAIL 8 — Day 14 (The Process Email)

**Subject:** Here's exactly what happens after you say "let's go"

**Body:**

[First Name],

People ask me: "What does the process look like?"

Here's the exact timeline:

**Week 1-2: Strategy + Market Analysis**
- 60-minute deep dive on your income, tax situation, and goals
- My app scans 300-500 properties in your target markets
- We identify the top 3-5 candidates (out of hundreds, only ~4 qualify)

**Week 3-4: Property Acquisition**
- I walk you through each property with full revenue projections
- We make offers, negotiate, handle inspection contingencies
- You close on the best deal

**Week 5-8: The Build-Out**
- Full renovation management (if needed)
- Professional interior design + furnishing
- Every single item — from beds to bottle openers — handled
- Professional photography + videography

**Week 9-10: Launch**
- Listing optimization across all platforms (Airbnb, VRBO, direct)
- Dynamic pricing algorithm setup
- Launch protocol activated (first bookings within 48 hours)

**Week 11-12: Optimization**
- Revenue monitoring + price adjustments
- Guest communication systems live
- Maintenance + cleaning crews in place
- Cost segregation study initiated

**Day 90: You're a cash-flowing STR owner with a massive tax deduction.**

That's what full-service means. You write a check. I build you a business.

### EMAIL 9 — Day 17 (Urgency/Scarcity)

**Subject:** I'm closing my Q2 waitlist in 10 days

**Body:**

[First Name],

Quick update.

I take 5-10 new homes per month. That's it. More than that, and quality drops. I didn't build a 4.95-star reputation by overextending.

Right now, Q2 spots are almost full. I have [2-3] openings left.

After that, the next available slot is Q3 — which means your first revenue wouldn't come until late summer, and your tax savings wouldn't hit until next year's filing.

If you've been thinking about this, now's the time to at least have the conversation.

The call is free. It's 60 minutes. I'll run your numbers, show you what's possible in your market, and give you a clear picture of the tax savings.

No pressure. No pitch deck. Just math.

But I do need you to book before those last spots fill:

👉 https://calendly.com/chitabnb/60min

Chi Ta

P.S. — The $650K home that made $24K in month one? That client booked his call the day he got this exact email. Just saying.

### EMAIL 10 — Day 21 (Final / Breakup)

**Subject:** Last email from me (unless you want more)

**Body:**

[First Name],

This is my last email in this sequence. I don't believe in pestering people.

Here's a quick summary of everything I've shared:

✅ 100% bonus depreciation + cost segregation = $100K-$400K in tax savings (year one)
✅ Full-service STR setup — you buy the property, I build the business
✅ $2.4M/year across 30 units, 4.95 stars, 20 years of experience
✅ Proprietary app scans 300-500 homes/day — only ~4 qualify
✅ $40K fee pays for itself 3-8x in tax savings alone
✅ $650K home → $24K first month | $310K cabin → $15K in 10 days
✅ 3-month waitlist, 5-10 homes/month max

If the timing isn't right, I completely understand. Keep my info. Come back when it makes sense.

But if you've been sitting on this because you're "not sure" or "want to think about it" — I'll say this:

Every month you wait is a month of rent you're not collecting and a year of depreciation you can't get back. Bonus depreciation won't last forever.

One call. 60 minutes. Real numbers for your specific situation.

👉 https://calendly.com/chitabnb/60min

It's been a pleasure, [First Name]. I hope to hear from you.

### SECTION 8: FAQ
**Headline (H2):**
> Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What does the $40K fee cover?**
> Everything. Market research, property sourcing, negotiation support, full renovation management, professional furnishing, photography, listing creation, pricing optimization, and launch. You buy the property — I build the business on top of it.

**Q: How much can I actually save in taxes?**
> Depends on your income and the property, but most clients save $100K-$400K+ in year one through cost segregation and bonus depreciation. I'll show you the exact numbers on our call.

**Q: I don't have time to manage a rental.**
> You don't have to. This is fully done-for-you. I handle setup and can connect you with ongoing management. Many of my clients are surgeons, attorneys, and executives who never touch their properties.

**Q: What if the market crashes or STRs get regulated?**
> I started during COVID and thrived. Proper market selection accounts for regulatory risk. And a well-positioned STR in the right market performs through downturns. My 20 years of experience includes multiple market cycles.

**Q: How do I know my property will perform?**
> My app scans 300-500 homes per day and only ~4 qualify. We don't guess — we analyze data on occupancy rates, average nightly rates, seasonality, competition, and regulatory environment before recommending a single property.

**Q: Is there really a 3-month waitlist?**
> Yes. I cap at 5-10 homes per month to maintain quality. First come, first served. The strategy call gets you in the queue.

# 9. SALES CALL FRAMEWORK

## Pre-Call Prep (5 minutes)
- Review lead source (where they opted in)
- Check LinkedIn/social for income signals
- Note any email replies or DM conversations
- Have calculator + cost seg examples ready

---

## CALL STRUCTURE (60 minutes)

### Phase 1: Rapport + Positioning (0-5 min)

**Opening:**
> "Hey [Name], appreciate you taking the time. Before we dive in, I want to set expectations — this isn't a sales pitch. I'm going to ask you some questions about your situation, and by the end, you'll know exactly whether this makes sense for you or not. Sound good?"

**Transition:**
> "Quick background on me so you know who you're talking to — I've been in real estate 20 years, I manage 30 short-term rental units, 4.95-star average, and my portfolio does about $2.4 million a year. I build STR businesses for high-income earners as a tax strategy. That's the short version. Now I want to hear about YOU."

---

### Phase 2: Discovery (5-20 min)

**Income + Tax Situation:**
> "What's your approximate W-2 or total income this year?"
> "What did you pay in taxes last year — roughly?"
> "How does that number make you feel?"
> "What has your CPA recommended for tax reduction?"
> "Do you have a tax strategist or just a tax preparer?"

**Real Estate Experience:**
> "Do you currently own any investment properties?"
> "Have you looked into short-term rentals before?"
> "What's held you back so far?"

**Goals + Timeline:**
> "If we could set up a property that cash flows AND saves you $200K+ in taxes this year — what would that mean for you?"
> "How quickly are you looking to move on something like this?"
> "Do you have capital ready, or would you be financing?"

**Decision Process:**
> "Is there anyone else involved in this decision — spouse, business partner, advisor?"
> "What would need to be true for you to move forward on something like this?"

---

### Phase 3: Education + Presentation (20-40 min)

**The Tax Strategy:**
> "Let me walk you through how this works. Are you familiar with cost segregation and bonus depreciation? [Explain regardless] When you buy a short-term rental — and this is key, it has to be SHORT-term, average rental period under 7 days — you can do what's called a cost segregation study. This reclassifies components of the property into shorter depreciation schedules. Combined with 100% bonus depreciation, you can potentially write off the ENTIRE purchase price in year one. Against your W-2 income."

**Run Their Numbers:**
> "So you said you make about [X]. Let's say we find you a property at $[Y]. Here's what the math looks like..."
> [Walk through: Purchase price → cost seg → depreciation amount → tax savings at their bracket → net cost after savings → projected revenue → real ROI]

**Case Studies:**
> "Let me give you two real examples. I had a client buy a $650K home in an event market. First month: $24,000 in revenue. $3,000-$4,000 a night during peak events. Another client — $310K cabin in the Poconos. $15,000 in the first 10 days."

**The Process:**
> "Here's exactly what happens if we work together..." [Walk through the 90-day timeline]

**The App:**
> "I built a proprietary app that scans 300-500 homes every single day. Out of those, about 4 qualify. That's less than 1%. My clients don't get average properties. They get properties that are mathematically validated to perform."

---

### Phase 4: Close (40-55 min)

**Trial Close:**
> "Based on everything we've talked about, does this make sense for your situation?"
> [Wait for response]

**If Yes:**
> "Great. Here's how we move forward. The full-service fee is $40,000. That covers everything from property sourcing through launch — you'll have a cash-flowing, tax-optimized STR within 90 days. I currently have [X] spots open for [month]. Want me to lock one in for you?"

**If Hesitant:**
> "What questions do you still have?"
> [Address, then re-close]

---

### Phase 5: Wrap-Up (55-60 min)

**If they commit:**
> "Awesome. I'll send you the agreement and onboarding docs today. Welcome aboard — this is going to be a great move for you."

**If they need time:**
> "Totally understand. Here's what I'd recommend — I can hold a spot for you for 7 days. After that, it goes to the next person on the waitlist. Take the time you need, talk to [spouse/partner], and let me know by [date]. Fair?"

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### Objection 1: "$40K is too much"

> "I hear you — $40K is real money. Let me reframe it though. This isn't a fee for a service. It's the entry point to a tax strategy. If you're earning $500K, you're probably paying $150K-$200K in taxes. This $40K triggers a cost segregation + bonus depreciation strategy that saves you $100K-$400K in year one. So the question isn't 'Can I afford $40K?' — it's 'Can I afford NOT to save $200K in taxes?' The $40K pays for itself three to eight times over before the property makes a single dollar in rent."

### Objection 2: "I need to talk to my spouse/partner"

> "Of course. Here's what I'd suggest — I can do a quick 15-minute call with both of you where I walk through the numbers together. That way they hear it directly instead of secondhand. Would Tuesday or Thursday work better?"

### Objection 3: "I need to talk to my CPA first"

> "Absolutely — and I'd actually encourage that. But I'll warn you: most CPAs don't specialize in this. Cost segregation and bonus depreciation for STRs is a niche tax strategy. If your CPA hasn't brought it up by now, they may not be familiar with it. I'm happy to get on a call with your CPA to walk them through it, or I can connect you with a CPA who specializes in real estate tax strategy. What would be more helpful?"

### Objection 4: "I can do this myself"

> "You absolutely could. And if you have 200+ hours and 20 years of market knowledge, you probably should. But most of my clients are surgeons, attorneys, and executives who earn $500K+ precisely because they focus on what they're best at. They hire me for the same reason — my 30 units and 4.95-star average didn't happen by accident. The DIY approach typically leaves 30-50% of revenue on the table and misses the tax strategy entirely. How much is your time worth per hour?"

### Objection 5: "What if STR regulations change?"

> "Great question — this is exactly why market selection matters so much. My app doesn't just look at revenue potential. It factors in regulatory environment, political climate, and zoning trends. I avoid markets with pending restrictions. I also structure properties to comply with the strictest interpretations. In 20 years through multiple cycles, including COVID, I haven't had a single property shut down. Risk management is built into the model."

### Objection 6: "What if the market crashes / recession?"

> "I built my portfolio DURING the worst economic crisis in recent memory. COVID. While other hosts shut down, I rented to stranded travelers and essential workers. I also helped landlords get loan modifications during that time. A well-positioned STR with the right pricing strategy is more recession-resistant than a long-term rental because you can adjust rates daily. And remember — even if revenue dips, the tax savings are locked in from day one. The depreciation doesn't go away."

### Objection 7: "I don't have time to manage a rental"

> "That's the whole point. You don't manage anything. I set up everything — operations, cleaning crews, guest communication, maintenance. You can plug in a property manager for ongoing operations, or I can recommend one. My clients check their bank account once a month. That's their involvement."

### Objection 8: "I've heard Airbnb is oversaturated"

> "In SOME markets, absolutely. Which is exactly why I built the app. 300-500 homes scanned daily. Only 4 qualify. We don't go where everyone else goes. We go where the data says there's demand and low supply. The people who say Airbnb is oversaturated picked their market based on a YouTube video. My clients pick markets based on data science."

### Objection 9: "The 3-month waitlist is too long"

> "I understand the urgency. But the waitlist exists because I cap at 5-10 homes per month. That's how I maintain 4.95 stars across 30 units. If I took everyone who applied, my quality would drop, my reviews would drop, and my clients' revenue would drop. The waitlist is actually your protection — it means when it's YOUR turn, you're getting my full attention. And honestly, 3 months to set up a property that saves you $200K+ in taxes and cash flows for decades? That's fast."

### Objection 10: "Let me think about it"

> "Totally fair. Can I ask what specifically you want to think about? Is it the investment amount, the timing, or something else? [Listen] Here's what I'd recommend — I'll hold a spot for you for one week. Not to pressure you, but because I have 14 people on the waitlist behind you and I want to be fair to everyone. Use the week to talk to your CPA, your spouse, whoever you need to. And if it's not right, no hard feelings at all."

### Objection 11: "I don't know anything about Airbnb/STR"

> "Perfect. You're not supposed to. That's my job. You know how to earn $500K+. I know how to turn real estate into tax-optimized cash flow. You don't need to learn about STRs any more than you need to learn about plumbing to live in a house. I handle everything. Your job is to buy the property and collect the income."

### Objection 12: "How do I know you're legit?"

> "Fair question. 4.95 stars across 30 units — that's publicly verifiable. 20 years in real estate. $2.4M in annual revenue. My biggest client has 60 homes and a $30M budget with me. I'm happy to connect you with three current clients who can tell you their experience firsthand. Would that help?"

# 10. CPA PARTNERSHIP PLAYBOOK

## Why CPAs?

CPAs who serve high-income clients ($500K+) are sitting on a goldmine of referrals and don't know it. Their clients are BEGGING for tax strategies. The CPA's toolbox is limited to:
- Max 401K ($23K)
- SEP-IRA
- Charitable giving
- Entity structuring

They DON'T have an answer for "How do I save $200K in taxes?" You do.

## The CPA Value Proposition

**For the CPA:**
- Hero to their client (massive tax savings they couldn't deliver alone)
- Client retention (clients stop looking for "better" CPAs)
- Referral fee ($2,000-$4,000 per closed client)
- Zero liability (you handle the real estate, they handle the tax filing)
- Differentiation (they can now market "advanced tax strategies")

**For Their Client:**
- $100K-$400K in year-one deductions
- Cash-flowing asset
- Long-term wealth building

### COLD EMAIL 1 — The Opener

**Subject:** Tax strategy your high-income clients are asking about

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

I'll keep this brief.

I help high-income earners ($500K+) purchase short-term rental properties and use cost segregation + 100% bonus depreciation to generate $100K-$400K in year-one deductions.

I manage 30 units personally. 4.95-star average. 20 years in real estate. My clients include a portfolio investor with 60 homes and a $30M budget.

I'm reaching out because I partner with CPAs who serve high-income clients. Here's how it works:

- You refer a client who's looking for tax strategy beyond the usual 401K/charity playbook
- I handle everything: property sourcing, acquisition support, full setup, launch
- Your client gets a massive year-one deduction + cash-flowing asset
- You get to file a return with a $200K+ cost seg deduction (your client thinks you're a genius)
- You receive a referral fee of $2,000-$4,000 per closed client

There's zero liability on your end. I handle the real estate. You handle the tax filing.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call this week? I can walk you through the exact structure and show you a sample cost seg study.

### COLD EMAIL 2 — The Follow-Up (4 days later)

**Subject:** Re: Tax strategy your high-income clients are asking about

**Body:**

Hi [Name],

Following up on my last email. I know your inbox is a warzone, so here's the TL;DR:

**Client buys STR → Cost seg study → Bonus depreciation → $200K+ year-one deduction → You file it → Client loves you → You get paid a referral fee.**

Real example: $650K home → $24K in month one → entire purchase price written off in year one.

15 minutes. I'll walk you through it. If it's not a fit, no worries at all.

Best,
Chi Ta

Quick summary: I help CPAs deliver $100K-$400K in first-year tax deductions to their high-income clients through short-term rental properties + cost segregation. The CPA earns a referral fee and looks like a hero.

If the timing isn't right, totally understand. But if any of your clients ask about real estate tax strategies this year, I'd love to be your go-to resource.

## Sample CPA Co-Marketing Email
(CPA sends this to their client list)

**Subject:** A tax strategy I've been researching for clients earning $500K+

**Body:**

Hi [Client Name],

As your CPA, I'm always looking for legitimate strategies to reduce your tax burden.

I've recently partnered with Chi Ta at Double My Rental — a specialist in short-term rental investments structured for maximum tax benefit.

Here's the short version: by purchasing a short-term rental property and conducting a cost segregation study, you may be able to deduct $100,000-$400,000+ in year one through bonus depreciation. Against your W-2 income.

Chi has 20 years of real estate experience, manages 30 units personally with a 4.95-star average, and handles everything from property sourcing to setup to launch.

This isn't for everyone — it's specifically designed for high-income earners looking for significant, legal tax reduction.

If you'd like to explore this, I'd recommend booking a strategy call with Chi directly:

👉 https://calendly.com/chitabnb/60min

I've reviewed the structure and I'm comfortable with the tax strategy. Happy to discuss on our next call.

Best,
[CPA Name]

## CPA Objection Handling

### "I've never heard of this strategy"
> "That's actually common — cost segregation + STR bonus depreciation is niche. It sits at the intersection of real estate and tax strategy, so it doesn't come up in traditional CPA training. I can walk you through a sample cost seg study and the IRS guidelines. Once you see it, you'll realize you probably have 5-10 clients right now who would benefit."

### "Is this legal / will it trigger an audit?"
> "100% legal. Cost segregation has been used since the 1960s. It's specifically supported by the IRS — there are revenue rulings, tax court cases, and established guidelines. I work with certified cost segregation engineers who produce audit-proof studies. Happy to share the relevant IRS guidance."

### "I don't do referral fees"
> "Totally respect that. Forget the fee entirely — what if we just structured this as you recommending a specialist to your client? Like you'd recommend an estate attorney or a financial advisor. The value for you is client retention and satisfaction. They stop looking for a 'better CPA' because you just saved them $200K."

### "My clients aren't real estate people"
> "That's actually the perfect client. They don't WANT to be real estate people. They want tax savings and passive income. Chi handles literally everything — they buy a property and collect income. Your surgeon clients, attorney clients, executive clients — they're the ideal fit because they have high income, no time, and a massive tax problem."

### "What's the risk for me?"
> "Zero. You're not giving investment advice. You're connecting your client with a real estate professional — the same way you'd refer them to an estate attorney. I handle all the real estate. You handle the tax filing. The cost seg study is produced by a certified engineering firm. Your liability is exactly the same as filing any other depreciation schedule."
