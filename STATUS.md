## 🔴 MUST DO BEFORE LAUNCH
1. **[ ] DNS propagation** — nameservers switched to Vercel, waiting for propagation (~1-24 hrs)
2. **[ ] Edit hero + pre-call videos** — Chi Ta has editor, raw HeyGen files ready
3. **[ ] Embed hero video** on landing page (a.html hero section)
4. **[ ] Embed pre-call video** on apply.html thank-you / email sequence
5. **[ ] Load 7-email nurture sequence into ConvertKit** — need to create sequence in CK UI
6. **[ ] Connect capture.html to ConvertKit form** — need form ID from CK
7. **[ ] Import 11K physician leads** into ConvertKit
8. **[ ] Send first email blast** (lead magnet delivery)
9. **[ ] Retargeting pixel** on landing page (Meta + Google)

## 🟡 HIGH IMPACT (do within first week)
- [ ] 3 retargeting ad creatives designed
- [ ] LinkedIn outreach to warm leads (need Chi Ta's LinkedIn access)
- [ ] 5 FB group posts (written, need Chi Ta's FB access via Camoufox)
- [ ] Reddit karma building (account has 0 karma)
- [ ] Record & post first 3 short-form videos (scripts 1, 3, 5)
- [ ] Cold email outreach system (Resend API ready)
- [ ] Affiliate recruitment outreach

## 🟢 NICE TO HAVE

## BLOCKERS
1. ⏳ **DNS propagation** — site temporarily down during nameserver switch to Vercel
2. 🎬 **Video editing** — Chi Ta has editor, needs to send raw files for editing
3. 📧 **ConvertKit sequence** — needs to be created in CK UI (API can't create sequences)
4. 🔑 **FB/LinkedIn access** — need Chi Ta to do Camoufox login sessions
