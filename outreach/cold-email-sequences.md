# Cold Email Sequences — 5 Angles

## Sequence 1: TAX ANGLE (Best for doctors, dentists, lawyers)

### Email 1
**Subject:** Your tax bill could fund a property that pays you every month

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick question: are you comfortable with what you're paying in taxes this year?

If you're earning $500K+, you're probably sending $175K-$350K to the IRS. Every year.

What if that money built you an asset instead?

I help high earners acquire short-term rental properties that generate $40K-$50K/year in passive cash flow — AND offset $50K-$100K+ in taxes through bonus depreciation.

One client (dentist, $700K income) cut their tax bill by $70K in Year 1 while adding $45K in new passive income.

The $40K setup fee? Paid for itself in tax savings alone.

Would a 15-minute call make sense to see if this fits your situation?

### Email 2 (Day 3)
**Subject:** Re: Your tax bill could fund a property

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to share a quick case study:

→ $650K property, 10% down ($65K)
→ $130K/year revenue, $40.9K net cash flow
→ 50.5% cash-on-cash return
→ $72K Year 1 tax savings

Total Year 1 return: 139% on invested capital.

We guarantee 15% minimum yield — or we manage the property for free.

Worth a conversation?

### Email 3 (Day 7)
**Subject:** Last note on the tax strategy

Hi {{first_name}},

I'll keep this brief — I know you're busy.

We're taking 5-10 new clients this month. Each gets a fully managed STR property that generates cash flow, tax savings, and appreciation.

If now isn't the right time, no worries. But if you'd like to see the math for your income level, here's my calendar:

Either way, wishing you a great quarter.

## Sequence 2: ROI ANGLE (Best for tech execs, finance)

### Email 1
**Subject:** 50% cash-on-cash returns (not crypto, not stocks)

Hi {{first_name}},

What asset class delivers 50% cash-on-cash returns, $50K+ in tax deductions, and 8% annual appreciation — with a management guarantee?

Short-term rental real estate. Specifically, the way I do it.

I manage $100M+ in STR properties across 16 states. Forbes featured my approach. Our worst return: 20% CoC. Best: 100% CoC Year 1. Average: 35-50%.

If you have $150K+ available and want to put it to work, I'd love to show you the math.

## Sequence 3: PASSIVE INCOME ANGLE (Broad appeal)

### Email 1
**Subject:** $40K/year passive income — no management required

Hi {{first_name}},

What would an extra $40,000/year in truly passive income mean for your family?

Not "passive" where you answer calls at midnight. Not "passive" where you manage contractors. Actually passive — someone else handles everything.

That's what I build. Fully managed short-term rental properties that generate $40K-$50K/year in net cash flow. My team handles guests, cleaning, maintenance, supplies — 24/7/365.

If we don't hit 15% yield, we manage for free.

I help 5-10 investors per month get started. Would you like to see if you qualify?

## Sequence 4: WEALTH BUILDING (Best for high net worth)

### Email 1
**Subject:** Building a $5M real estate portfolio in 5 years

Hi {{first_name}},

One of my clients started with a single $650K property and $81K cash in.

3 years later: 4 properties worth $2.8M. Cash flow: $180K/year. Tax savings: $200K+ cumulative.

By Year 5, projected portfolio value: $5M+.

This isn't speculation. It's the math of leveraged real estate with premium STR revenue.

My biggest client has 60 homes and a $30M budget. He started with one property too.

If you'd like to see a portfolio projection for your capital level, I'd be happy to run the numbers on a quick call.
