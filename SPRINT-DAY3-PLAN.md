# DAY 3 BLITZ PLAN — Feb 21, 2026
## Goal: First warm lead by end of Day 4, booked call by Day 5-6, customer by Day 7

## Reality Check
- 192 physician leads scraped, but ZERO emails/phones (enrichment failing)
- No email platform set up yet
- Cold email sequences written but nowhere to send them
- Funnel is built but has ZERO traffic

## Channel Strategy (parallel execution)

### 1. FACEBOOK GROUPS — Fastest to Warm Leads (TODAY)
Chi Ta's bread and butter. Post value content in high-earner FB groups:
- Physician Finance groups
- High-income tax strategy groups  
- Real estate investing groups
- STR/Airbnb host groups
Target: 5-10 value posts today, each ending with soft CTA to doublemyrental.com

### 2. LINKEDIN OUTREACH — Direct to Decision Makers (TODAY)
- Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator or basic search
- Target: physicians, dentists, attorneys, tech execs in CA, TX, FL
- Send connection requests with personalized note
- Follow up with value message + Calendly link
- Target: 50 connection requests today

### 3. COLD EMAIL via Instantly.ai or Mailchimp (TODAY if Chi Ta approves)
- Need: email platform + domain for cold sending
- Can use ckl@fastmail.com for warm outreach immediately
- Target: 20 personalized cold emails today to findable doctors

### 4. REDDIT — Value Posts (TODAY)
- r/fatFIRE, r/whitecoatinvestor, r/RealEstateInvesting, r/AirBnB
- Long-form value posts about STR tax strategy
- No selling, just value + "DM me if you want the spreadsheet"
- Target: 3 quality posts today

### 5. LEAD ENRICHMENT FIX — Get Real Emails
- Hunter.io domain search for medical practices
- Apollo.io free tier (50 credits/mo)
- Google "[Doctor Name] [City] email" manual enrichment for top 20 leads
- Target: 50 enriched leads with real emails by end of today

## Priority Order
1. FB group posts (Camoufox) — can start NOW
2. Reddit value posts — can start NOW  
3. Manual lead enrichment (top 20 physicians) — start NOW
4. LinkedIn outreach — needs Chi Ta's LinkedIn access
5. Cold email — needs platform decision

## Success Metrics
- Day 3: 10+ FB posts live, 3 Reddit posts, 20+ enriched leads
- Day 4: First inbound inquiry or reply
- Day 5: First Calendly booking
- Day 6-7: Call completed, close
