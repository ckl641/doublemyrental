## POST 1 — Tax Strategy (r/fatFIRE style value bomb)

**For groups:** Physician Finance, White Coat Investor, High Income Professionals

I've been helping physicians and attorneys reduce their tax burden using short-term rentals for the past 7 years. Here's the exact strategy in plain English:

The setup:
→ Buy an investment property in a high-demand STR market ($500K-$1M)
→ Put 10% down using a DSCR loan (no income verification needed)
→ Get a cost segregation study ($3-7K)
→ Materially participate (100+ hours/year)
→ Accelerate 20-40% of purchase price as Year 1 depreciation

Real example from a recent client:
→ $650K property, $81K total cash in
→ $130K/year gross revenue on Airbnb
→ $40,900/year net cash flow (50.5% CoC return)
→ $70K accelerated depreciation = ~$28K tax savings at 40% bracket
→ Year 1 total return: $120,900 on $81K invested (149% ROI)

The key that most CPAs miss: STRs with average stays under 7 days qualify as active business income IF you materially participate. This means losses can offset your W-2 income — unlike traditional long-term rentals which are passive by default.

For high earners ($500K+), the tax savings alone often exceed the down payment within 12-18 months. Add cash flow + appreciation and it becomes hard to justify NOT doing this.

Happy to answer any questions. Been doing this across 16 states.

## POST 2 — Deal Breakdown (Math-heavy)

**For groups:** Real Estate Investing, Airbnb Hosts, STR Investors

Just closed on a property last month. Here's the full deal breakdown for anyone interested in the math:

🏠 Purchase: $650K
💰 Down payment: $65K (10% DSCR loan)
🎮 Game room buildout: $10K
🔨 Contractors: $6K
📊 Total cash in: $81K

Revenue breakdown:
• Gross: $130K/year
• PITI: $36K
• Management (15%): $19.5K
• Cleaning: $18K
• Utilities: $9.6K
• Other (pool, landscape, supplies, maintenance): $6K
• Total expenses: $89.1K
• NET cash flow: $40,900/year

That's a 50.5% cash-on-cash return.

But here's what most people miss — the tax angle:
• Cost segregation → $70K accelerated depreciation
• At 40% tax bracket → $28K saved in Year 1
• Plus 8% appreciation → $52K Year 1

True all-in return: $120,900 on $81K = 149%

The property charges $3-4K/night during peak events. We don't chase occupancy — we chase maximum dollars during high-demand windows.

Questions welcome. I've been buying and managing STRs for about 20 years now.

## POST 3 — Soft Story Post

**For groups:** Any high-income group

Quick story: A dental couple came to me last year. Combined income $1.2M. Tax bill was destroying them.

We found them a property, set it up with a glow-in-the-dark game room (sounds crazy, but Airbnb photos with black backgrounds and neon colors get 3x the clicks), and had their first booking within 2 weeks of going live.

Their Year 1 tax savings alone were over $150K. They bought a second property within 6 months.

Almost every one of my clients buys a second property. Not because I'm a good salesman — because the numbers just make sense once you see them in action.

If you're a high earner ($500K+) and curious about using STRs to legally offset your tax burden, I'm happy to run the numbers for your specific situation. No pitch — just math.

## POST 4 — Question/Engagement Post

**For groups:** Any

Poll for the group: What's your biggest hesitation with investing in Airbnb/STRs?

A) Regulations / city restrictions
B) Don't have time to manage
C) Don't know how to find good deals
D) Worried about market downturn
E) Don't understand the tax benefits

Genuinely curious. I've been in this space for ~20 years and can probably address most of these.

## POST 5 — Hot Take

**For groups:** Real Estate, STR, Physician Finance

Unpopular opinion: If you're a W-2 earner making $500K+ and you DON'T own at least one short-term rental, you're voluntarily overpaying taxes by $50-150K per year.

With 100% bonus depreciation back, cost segregation, and material participation rules — STRs are the single most powerful legal tax shelter available to high earners right now.

And no, you don't need to manage it yourself. Full-service management exists (that's literally what I do).

The real question isn't "should I invest in STRs" — it's "how much am I losing by waiting another year?"

Change my mind.
