# 🎯 DOUBLE MY RENTAL — FRACTIONAL CMO AUDIT & FUNNEL STRATEGY
**Date:** February 21, 2026
**Prepared by:** Charles (Fractional CMO)
**For:** Chi Ta, Founder — Double My Rental

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

You have a $40K high-ticket offer with a 15% yield guarantee, $100M+ AUM credibility, Forbes feature, and a proprietary deal-finding app. That's a top 1% offer in the STR space. Your funnel problem isn't the product — it's that you have no systematic way to take a stranger and turn them into a booked call. You have a collection of pages, not a funnel. Let me fix that.

**Current State:** 6/10 — Good assets, bad architecture. No connected flow. No tracking. No automation.
**Target State:** 10/10 — Every touchpoint connected, tracked, and optimized.

## 3. RECOMMENDED TECH STACK

| Tool | Purpose | Cost | Why This One | Scale Upgrade |
|------|---------|------|-------------|---------------|
| **ConvertKit** | Email marketing, sequences, automations | $29/mo ✅ ACTIVE | Already set up. Best for creators, great automation builder, good deliverability. Handles everything we need for email. | Kit Pro ($59/mo) when over 1K subs |
| **Calendly** | Call booking | Free (1 event) ✅ ACTIVE | Already using. Simple, reliable, integrates with everything. | Calendly Pro ($12/mo) for reminders + routing |
| **Vercel** | Landing pages hosting | Free ✅ ACTIVE | Already deployed. Fast, free, reliable. Static HTML = no build complexity. | Stay on free tier indefinitely |
| **Twilio** | SMS reminders + follow-up | ~$0.01/SMS | Cheapest reliable SMS. API-based = full control. Appointment reminders, no-show recovery. | Already cheap at scale |
| **Google Analytics 4** | Website analytics | Free | Industry standard. Track every page view, event, conversion. | Free forever |
| **Meta Pixel + CAPI** | Facebook/Instagram ad tracking | Free | Required for any Meta advertising. Server-side tracking via Conversions API for accuracy. | Free forever |
| **Google Tag Manager** | Pixel/event management | Free | One tag container for all tracking. Easy to manage without code changes. | Free forever |
| **Hotjar or Microsoft Clarity** | Heatmaps + session recordings | Free (Clarity) | See exactly where people drop off on your landing page. Clarity is 100% free, unlimited. | Hotjar ($39/mo) for surveys |
| **Resend** | Transactional email (confirmations) | Free (100/day) ✅ ACTIVE | Already set up. API key ready. For confirmation emails, not marketing. | $20/mo at scale |
| **Zapier or Make** | Automation glue | Free (100 tasks) | Connect ConvertKit → Calendly → SMS → CRM. Automate everything. | Make Pro ($9/mo) |
| **Notion or Google Sheets** | CRM (for now) | Free | Track leads, calls, deals manually until volume justifies a real CRM. | HubSpot Free CRM when doing 20+ calls/mo |
| **Loom** | Quick video content | Free | Record explainers, testimonial requests, async follow-up. | Pro ($12.50/mo) |
| **Canva** | Social graphics + ad creatives | Free | Design ads, social posts, PDFs without a designer. | Pro ($13/mo) for brand kit |
| **HeyGen** | AI video (Chi Ta avatar) | API ✅ ACTIVE | Pre-call video, social content, personalized outreach videos. | Already have API access |

### What NOT to buy right now:
- ❌ **GoHighLevel** ($97-297/mo) — Overkill. You don't need a full CRM platform until you're doing 50+ calls/month.
- ❌ **ClickFunnels** ($147/mo) — You already have landing pages on Vercel for free.
- ❌ **Salesforce** — Way too complex for your stage.
- ❌ **Instantly.ai** ($30/mo) — Not yet. Only when you have enriched leads with verified emails.

**Total monthly cost right now: ~$29/mo** (just ConvertKit)
**Total monthly cost at scale: ~$100-150/mo** (ConvertKit + Calendly Pro + Twilio + Make)

## 5. BOOKING FLOW OPTIMIZATION

### Current Flow (Broken):
```
Landing page → Calendly link → Call
(No qualification, no pre-call content, no reminders)
```

### Ideal Flow:
```
Landing page → Lead magnet opt-in → Thank you page (with Calendly embed)
                                        ↓
                              Books call on thank you page
                                        ↓
                              Application form (/apply)
                              - Annual income
                              - Tax bracket
                              - Available capital
                              - Timeline (3mo / 6mo / 12mo)
                              - Markets interested in
                              - How did you hear about us?
                                        ↓
                              Confirmation page
                              - "You're confirmed!"
                              - Pre-call video (HeyGen Chi Ta)
                              - "3 Things to Prepare" checklist
                              - Calendar invite auto-sent
                                        ↓
                              Pre-call email sequence (see above)
                              - 24h reminder + video
                              - 1h SMS reminder
                              - 5min SMS reminder
                                        ↓
                              STRATEGY CALL
                              - Chi Ta has application data
                              - Prospect has watched video
                              - Prospect knows the numbers
                              - Close rate: 30-50% (vs 10-15% without this flow)
```

### Why This Matters:
- **Application = qualification filter.** You only talk to people who can actually buy ($500K+ income, 10% down available). Saves hours.
- **Pre-call video = pre-selling.** By the time they get on the call, they already trust you, know the numbers, and are mentally buying. You're just answering questions.
- **SMS reminders = show rate.** Industry data: email-only reminders = 40-50% show rate. Email + SMS = 70-80% show rate. That's 2x more calls that actually happen.
- **Application data = personalization.** "I see you're earning $700K and paying ~$280K in taxes. Let me show you how we can offset $100K of that in Year 1." That's a close.

### CRM Pipeline Stages:
```
1. LEAD          → Opted in for lead magnet
2. ENGAGED       → Opened 3+ emails or visited 3+ pages
3. APPLIED       → Submitted application form
4. BOOKED        → Scheduled strategy call
5. SHOWED        → Attended the call
6. PROPOSAL      → Received offer/numbers on call
7. CLOSED-WON    → Paid $20K deposit
8. CLOSED-LOST   → Declined (reason tagged)
9. NURTURE       → Not ready now, keep warm
```

### KPI Dashboard Template:

| Metric | Target Benchmark | Formula |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **Cost Per Lead (CPL)** | <$15 (paid), $0 (organic) | Ad spend ÷ leads |
| **Opt-in Rate** | >25% (landing page) | Opt-ins ÷ page visitors |
| **Email Open Rate** | >35% | Opens ÷ delivered |
| **Email Click Rate** | >5% | Clicks ÷ delivered |
| **Lead → Booked Call** | >15% | Calls booked ÷ total leads |
| **Show Rate** | >75% | Calls attended ÷ calls booked |
| **Close Rate** | >30% | Closed ÷ calls attended |
| **Cost Per Booked Call** | <$100 | Ad spend ÷ calls booked |
| **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)** | <$500 | Ad spend ÷ customers closed |
| **Customer LTV** | $40K+ | Setup fee + 15% mgmt fee × avg years |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | >10:1 | LTV ÷ CPA |
| **Time to Close** | <90 days | First touch → payment |

At $40K per customer and <$500 CPA, you're looking at **80:1 LTV:CAC ratio.** That's insane. Even at $2K CPA via paid, you're at 20:1. This business prints money once the funnel works.

## 7. ORGANIC CONTENT ENGINE — 90-Day Plan

### Platform Priority (ranked by audience fit):

| Platform | Priority | Why | Content Type | Cadence |
|----------|----------|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Facebook Groups** | 🔴 #1 | Your exact audience is here (RE investors, high earners) | Value posts, deal breakdowns, Q&A | 2-3 posts/day across 5-10 groups |
| **LinkedIn** | 🔴 #2 | $500K+ professionals live here | Thought leadership, tax tips, deal stories | 1 post/day |
| **X/Twitter** | 🟡 #3 | Already running, good for authority | Hot takes, deal math threads, engagement | 3-5 tweets/day (automated) |
| **YouTube** | 🟡 #4 | Long-term SEO, trust builder | Property tours, deal breakdowns, tax explainers | 1-2 videos/week |
| **Instagram** | 🟠 #5 | Visual proof — before/after, lifestyle | Reels, carousels, stories | 3-5 posts/week |
| **Blog/SEO** | 🟡 #3 | Evergreen traffic, backlinks | Long-form guides, city pages | 2 articles/week |
| **Reddit** | 🟠 #5 | r/fatFIRE, r/realestateinvesting | Expert comments, value bombs (no promotion) | 3-5 comments/week |
| **Podcast Guesting** | 🟢 #6 | Borrowed audience, trust transfer | Interview format | 2-4 appearances/month |

### Content Pillars (5 themes, rotate):

1. **💰 Deal Math** — Real numbers from real deals. "$650K property → $130K/yr revenue." People LOVE specific numbers.
2. **🏛️ Tax Strategy** — "How $500K earners offset $100K+ in taxes through STR investing." This is the #1 hook.
3. **🏠 Before/After** — Property transformations. Glow-in-the-dark game rooms. Visual proof that pops.
4. **📈 Market Intel** — "Top 5 STR markets right now and why." Positions you as the expert.
5. **🎤 Client Stories** — "Our client just got their first booking — $3,400 for one weekend." Social proof.

### 90-Day Content Calendar:

**MONTH 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation**
- Week 1-2: 5 FB group posts/day (value-first, no selling)
- Week 1-2: Daily LinkedIn posts (personal brand building)
- Week 1-4: 2 blog articles/week (SEO foundation — target "Airbnb cash on cash return", "STR tax benefits", "best Airbnb markets 2026")
- Week 1-4: X engine continues daily (3-5 tweets + 10 replies)
- Week 3-4: First YouTube video (deal breakdown or property tour)
- Week 3-4: Start Reddit karma building (helpful comments, no links)

**MONTH 2 (Days 31-60): Scale**
- FB groups: 3 posts/day + start DM conversations with engaged commenters
- LinkedIn: Daily posts + 20 connection requests/day to target audience
- Blog: 2 articles/week + update city pages with fresh data
- YouTube: 1 video/week (short-form repurposed from long)
- Instagram: Launch with 10 before/after property carousels
- Start podcast outreach (pitch 10 shows/week)

**MONTH 3 (Days 61-90): Optimize**
- Double down on what's working (check analytics for top traffic sources)
- FB groups: If driving leads, go to 5 posts/day + lives
- LinkedIn: If connections converting, add LinkedIn Ads ($500/mo test)
- YouTube: If views growing, increase to 2 videos/week
- Blog: If SEO ranking, write more long-tail content
- Launch referral program for existing leads/clients

### Repurposing Workflow:
```
1 Long-form piece (blog article or YouTube video)
  → 5 X/Twitter posts (key stats, quotes, hot takes)
  → 3 LinkedIn posts (story format, lessons, numbers)
  → 2 FB group posts (question format, value-first)
  → 1 Instagram carousel (visual summary)
  → 1 Email newsletter (weekly roundup)
  → 5 Reddit comments (use data points in relevant threads)
```

### SEO Strategy:
**Target keywords (high intent, achievable):**
- "airbnb investment returns" (1.2K/mo, medium difficulty)
- "short term rental tax benefits" (880/mo, medium)
- "airbnb cash on cash return calculator" (590/mo, low difficulty)
- "best cities for airbnb investment 2026" (1.5K/mo, medium)
- "airbnb property management service" (720/mo, high — long-term play)
- "cost segregation airbnb" (480/mo, low difficulty)
- "DSCR loan airbnb" (320/mo, low difficulty)
- "airbnb arbitrage vs ownership" (210/mo, low difficulty)

**SEO priorities:**
1. Expand blog to 20+ articles targeting these keywords
2. City pages need unique content (not just templates)
3. Internal linking between blog → calculator → lead capture
4. Build backlinks via guest posts, HARO, podcast show notes

## 12. SPECIFIC FIXES — Do These NOW

### Landing Page (a.html):
1. **Add exit-intent popup** — "Wait! Download the Tax Shield Blueprint before you go" → email capture
2. **Add sticky CTA bar** — Fixed bottom bar: "Book Your Free Strategy Call" that follows scroll
3. **Add video above the fold** — Even a 60-sec HeyGen video increases conversions 30%+
4. **Add specific number counter** — "Properties managed: 247 | States: 16 | Avg yield: 42%"
5. **Fix the CTA flow** — Every button should go to /tax-shield (lead capture) NOT directly to Calendly. Capture the email FIRST.

### Thank You Page:
1. **Embed Calendly directly** — Don't send them away. Book the call RIGHT on the thank you page.
2. **Add pre-call video** — "Watch this 2-minute video from Chi Ta before your call"
3. **Add urgency** — "We take 5-10 new clients per month. Book now to secure your spot."

### Capture Page:
1. **Connect to ConvertKit** — This is broken right now. Zero leads are being captured.
2. **Add social proof** — "Join 200+ high-earner investors" (even if aspirational for now)
3. **Simplify** — Name + email only. No phone yet. Reduce friction.

---

## BOTTOM LINE

You're sitting on a **$40K high-ticket offer with 80:1 LTV:CAC potential.** That's a machine waiting to be turned on. The product is elite. The funnel is the bottleneck.

**One paying client covers 115 months of your entire marketing tech stack.**

Priority order:
1. Connect ConvertKit → start capturing leads (TODAY)
2. Build /apply qualification page (THIS WEEK)
3. Produce pre-call video (THIS WEEK)
4. Get on Facebook groups and LinkedIn (THIS WEEK)
5. Install tracking pixels (THIS WEEK)
6. Everything else follows from there.

The first booked call is 3-5 days away if you give me Facebook and LinkedIn access today.

Let's go. 🔥
