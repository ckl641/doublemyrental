## THE NUMBERS
- **Biggest tax savings**: Plastic surgeon, two homes $1.5M each via 1031 exchange. Cost seg offset ~$900K income. Saved ~$325K in actual taxes.
- **Best CoC return**: 75% cash-on-cash. $35K down, home generates $120K/yr revenue.
- **Total clients served**: Several hundred since 2021
- **Repeat rate**: 75% buy a second home when financially able
- **Strategy call to first booking**: 120-150 days (90-day waitlist alone due to demand + stringent sourcing)

## CLIENT WINS
- **Thomas M.** — Plastic Surgeon, $1.5M income, offset nearly $1M with 2 homes
- **Mackenzie W.** — Dermatologist, $1M income, 1 home, offset ~$300K, saved $100K+ in taxes
- **Deepak S.** — Project Manager, $750K income, 1 home $750K, offset ~$225K
- **A.S.** — Went from 1 property to 60, portfolio worth $80M+
- **Skeptical dentist couple** — came in skeptical via 1031/Midas Wealth referral, bought 2 homes, both doing exceptionally well

## PAIN POINTS
- #1 frustration: TAXES. They come for tax savings, then discover they also get cashflow. Becomes a no-brainer.
- Dumbest move: Paying IRS when they could have write-offs. Leaving money in savings/CD accounts.
- CPA problem: Most CPAs don't understand STR strategy. It's new. They don't get paid for it, can't execute it, don't have background knowledge.

## OBJECTIONS
1. Price of service (top objection)
2. Don't have enough for down payment
3. Seems too complex
- **Market crash**: COVID was the ultimate crash. Couldn't travel at all. Airbnb was BETTER because people avoided hotels. Banks issued loan modifications postponing payments.
- **No time**: We do ALL the work — guest communication, maintenance, cleanings. Clients do nothing.
- **Oversaturation**: Airbnb grows YOY. Saturation only matters without competitive advantage. Proprietary software scans 400K homes, selects most profitable. Then get ranked top 1% on Airbnb — Airbnb promotes top 1% over others.

## UNIQUE EDGE
- Proprietary app scans every home for sale in USA (400K listings at any time)
- Get all homes ranked as top 1% performer on Airbnb
- Top 1% = charge more + more occupied = golden formula
- DSCR loans: 10% down, ~7.5% rate in today's market

## THE HOOK
- "You could've kept that entire $200K check in the form of equity. You could've used that to buy a house instead of paying the IRS. Either way the money won't be cash, but as equity you keep the money — and the home you own pays you instead."
- Emotional moment: When they finally understand, they go all in and buy as many homes as possible.
