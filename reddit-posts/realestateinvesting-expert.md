**Reply:**

I've been doing this for about 20 years across 16 states, managing $100M+ in STR properties. Here's what I'd look for in an "expert" on this:

**The strategy itself is straightforward:**
1. Buy investment property in a high-demand STR market
2. Get a cost segregation study (CSSI and Madison SPECS are both solid — expect $3-7K for a $500K-$1M property)
3. Materially participate (meet one of the 7 IRS tests — most common is 100+ hours/year AND more than anyone else)
4. Take bonus depreciation on the accelerated assets

**What actually matters is execution:**
- Can they FIND properties that actually yield 20%+? Most markets don't. We scan 100K+ homes and maybe 1% qualify.
- Can they set it up to maximize nightly rates? (Game rooms, resort amenities, professional photography — these aren't gimmicks, they're revenue multipliers)
- Can they MANAGE it so you actually hit those projections?

**Real numbers from a recent deal:**
- $650K property, $81K total cash in (10% down + game room + contractors)
- $130K/year gross, $40.9K net cash flow = 50.5% CoC
- $70K accelerated depreciation via cost seg = ~$28K tax savings (40% bracket)
- 8% appreciation = $52K Year 1
- All-in Year 1 ROI: 149%

**Big news:** The One Big Beautiful Bill Act just permanently restored 100% bonus depreciation. This is no longer phasing down — it's locked in. If you've been waiting, the window is wide open.

The key mistake I see: people focus on the tax strategy but buy a bad property. The property selection IS the strategy. If your deal doesn't pencil at 20%+ yield, no amount of cost segregation fixes that.

Happy to answer specific questions. This is literally all I do.
