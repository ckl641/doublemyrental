**Title:** How I legally offset $127K in W-2 income using short-term rentals + cost segregation (detailed breakdown)

**Body:**

I've been helping high-income professionals ($500K+) implement this strategy for several years now and wanted to share the exact playbook since I see a lot of misinformation about STR tax benefits.

**The Setup:**

1. Purchase an investment property in a high-demand STR market ($500K-$1M range)
2. Put 10% down using a DSCR loan (no income verification needed, based on property cash flow)
3. Get a cost segregation study done ($3K-$7K cost)
4. Materially participate (100+ hours/year — this is the key IRS requirement)
5. Accelerate 20-40% of the purchase price as Year 1 depreciation

**Real Example:**

- $650K property, $65K down (10%), $10K game room setup, $6K contractors = **$81K total cash in**
- Gross revenue: $130K/year on Airbnb
- Expenses: $89K/year (PITI $36K, management 15%, cleaning $18K, utilities, maintenance)
- **Net cash flow: $40,900/year = 50.5% cash-on-cash return**
- **Tax offset: $70K accelerated depreciation → ~$28K saved at 40% bracket**
- Appreciation: 8% compounding ($52K Year 1)
- **True all-in Year 1 ROI: $120,900 on $81K = 149%**

**The Tax Magic:**

Most people focus on cash flow, but the real win for high earners is the tax offset. If you're paying $150K+ in taxes annually, you can legally shelter a massive chunk of that through:

- **Bonus depreciation** (100% in 2026 for qualifying assets)
- **Cost segregation** (reclassifies building components from 27.5yr to 5-15yr depreciation)
- **Material participation** (STR loophole: meet 1 of 7 IRS tests, most common is 100+ hours AND more than anyone else)

The IRS considers STRs as active business income if you materially participate, which means losses can offset your W-2 income. This is NOT the case for traditional long-term rentals.

**Key Companies for Cost Seg:**
- CSSI (Cost Segregation Services Inc)
- Madison SPECS
- Most charge $3-7K for a study on a $500K-$1M property

**What Most People Get Wrong:**

1. You MUST materially participate. Just owning it and hiring a PM doesn't qualify.
2. The 100-hour test requires you to participate MORE hours than any other individual (including your PM). Track your hours meticulously.
3. This works best with STRs where average stay is 7 days or less. Long-term rentals are passive by default.
4. You need a CPA who understands real estate professional status and STR loopholes specifically.

**5-Year Wealth Build:**

On a $650K property:
- Year 1: $40.9K cash flow + $28K tax savings + $52K appreciation = $120.9K
- By Year 5: Property worth ~$955K (+$305K equity) + ~$200K cumulative cash flow
- Total wealth created: $500K+ on an $81K investment

Happy to answer questions. This is what I do full-time — find, set up, and manage these properties for busy professionals who want the returns without the headaches.
