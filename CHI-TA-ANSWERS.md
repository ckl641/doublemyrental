# Chi Ta — 35 CMO Questions (Raw Answers, Feb 20, 2026)

## 🎯 THE CLIENT

**1. Best client:** Couple who owns several dental practices on the east coast. Referred by Midas Wealth (wealth management group). Going through a 1031 exchange — Chi Ta had 14 days to find $4.5M of Airbnbs that cashflow, in legal areas, with appreciation. Sourced multiple. One fell out due to dishonest seller.

**2. #1 objection:** Price ($40K fee). #2: "What if this doesn't work?" — people stay quiet but are afraid.

**3. What holds them back:** Likely price, or lack of understanding. "My system works so well and it's quite complex it's hard for them to wrap their head around how we took such an extensively competitive field and dialed it down to simply the most profitable homes and do everything for them on auto pilot. We make something so hard look so simple."

**4. What clients say after closing:** Ed (Florida) initially hesitated — "Trust the process." Home doing extremely well, cash flowing heavy.

**5. Repeat rate:** Almost ALL clients repeat and buy a second home if they have enough capital. "Our cashflow is unreal."

**6. Bad experiences:** Yes — when clients go against Chi Ta's suggestions on amenities or limit his budget. Still gets them to top 1% in their class, top earning vs. similar nearby — just can't shatter the glass ceiling on revenue.

## 💰 THE OFFER

**7. Fee structure:** $20K down payment → goes into 3-month waitlist queue. Remaining $20K due when in escrow and property passes inspection. Total: $40K. Ongoing: 15% management fee (below industry standard for full white glove).

**8. First 30 days:** Sourcing begins. Wait list queue. Once their turn: identify property → introduce local realtor → connect with loan agent (10-15% down) → consult on offer pricing. Chi Ta has negotiated $100K off a $1M home and $100K off a $750K home — savings beyond his fee. After inspection: team designs property ("beer budget champagne taste"). Competitor "Funk It" charges $200K and doesn't source homes. DMR charges $40K + ~$60K furniture/contractor = $100K total vs $200K+. Helps setup Amazon Business account for furniture ordering. Assembles local teams + contractors. Client does NOTHING.

**9. Fastest to first booking:** Setup in 2 weeks. First booking immediately after.

**10. Strategy call to closed property:** ~90 days (assuming sign same week).

**11. Guarantee:** YES — 15% minimum yield guarantee. If they don't hit 15%, management fee is completely waived. They manage the home for FREE.

## 🏠 THE PROPERTIES

**12. Markets:** California, Texas, Colorado, Utah, Florida, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Ohio, Kentucky, Hawaii, Maryland, Washington DC, Virginia, South Carolina, Washington State (16 states).

**13. $3-4K/night:** Trade secret. Events that sell out an entire city.

**14. Price range:** $500K to $1M. Most land somewhere in between.

**15. Glow-in-dark game rooms (origin):** Chi Ta's idea. Science behind it: Airbnb's native background is WHITE. The ultimate contrast to white is BLACK. Every other listing shows gray/neutral living rooms. To stand out on the platform: pools and twilight photos (which Chi Ta popularized, now everyone copies). Next evolution: dark elements, glow-in-dark gamerooms. Built an entire paintball field with glow-in-dark paint + obstacle course.

**16. Coolest amenity:** Leveled a 1-acre field to build a glow-in-the-dark paintball course. Wall of paintball guns that glow in the dark. Glow-in-dark face masks. Only property with a paintball course in the entire area.

## 📊 THE NUMBERS

**17. Total properties/AUM:** Lost track of total count. Currently manage over $100M AUM.

**18. Returns range:** Best: 100% Cash-on-Cash Year 1. Average: 35-50%. Worst: 20% CoC.

**19. 60-home client:** Was a student ~early 2021. After Chi Ta showed the model, student raised a lot of capital. From there, consulted and purchased 1 home after another to scale his portfolio.

**20. Total annual revenue:** (Not answered)

## 🧠 YOUR EDGE

**21. Proprietary app (TRUTH):** Custom/proprietary. Uses AirDNA's API for data. NOBODY has their usage pattern. They scrape ALL of Zillow — every single home listed for sale. Then run bulk calls against AirDNA's API. Generate CSV to sort by yield. Only purchase 20%+ yield (can go to 15%).

**22. Loan officers:** Experienced mortgage brokers with many banking connections. Lenders that do 90% LTV on investment loans via bank statement deposits or DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio). Higher rates but worth it with less capital in + still cashflows.

**23. What NO other STR service does:** Full service from start to finish. Software finds the most profitable property (1 out of 100,000), helps negotiate ($100K off), assembles "the entire Avengers team" to set up the home, runs it 24/7/365 for passive income. No one else does this at scale profitably.

**24. Why not scaled past 5-10/month:** MARKETING is the real issue. Can't find enough clients. Also been very selective (20%+ yield only). Could bring threshold to 15% and be flooded with inventory.

## 📖 YOUR STORY

**25. The 2017 crash:** Dead broke. Sold Lamborghini, downtown SF loft, everything. $0 in bank. Almost homeless. Moved back to parents' spare room. Locked himself in for months. Fiancée left him. Broke and alone. Trusted employees at mortgage company stabbed him in the back — stole leads and funneled to another company. "It shows when you're down and out people you thought cared for you is all full of shit."

**26. COVID pivot:** Lenore (son's mother) changed — started stealing/funneling money because she was "scared" of being poor. Cash was 5 months old. Had to shut down many Airbnb properties. Stayed up until 2-3AM daily scripting YouTube videos (only work possible during shutdown). Got really good at content. Led to rebuilding BNB University (coaching program). By late 2020, teaching Airbnb, very successful. Feb 2021: huge fallout with Lenore — she and her brother provoked him daily. They stole the home, filed fake DV order. Homeless, no money, she stole bank account funds, couldn't see his son. Had to pivot to coaching students immediately. Dark time. Then met Amber (current partner, 5 years together). Currently struggling with income — shut down BNB University, not many students. Funnel is critical because it pays bills fastest.

**27. Origin:** Vietnamese immigrant, born 1984 in Ho Chi Minh City. Family immigrated to San Francisco December 1988 with nothing. 8 people in 500 sqft studio (grandma's). Parents worked $4.15/hr, 7 days/week, 12 hours/day in restaurants ($3K/month combined). First 14 years in Tenderloin District, SF. Dad still works at restaurant today (refuses to retire). Parents bought a $1.5M property on $4.15/hr — power of saving.

**Career timeline:** Age 24 (2008) → telemarketing pit, 600 cold calls/day, massive anxiety. Eventually became loan officer. First $10K month. By Jan 2009: $30K month. Spent it all. Depression. Moved to parents' basement. Mom slipped food under door for 3 months. One day took husky (Gabby) for a walk → that walk became daily runs → rebuild. Got 90/10 net branch deal → set record: $50K month. Built Senior Advantage Association. Hired guy who originally hired him into telemarketing. Rented Zappos' old SF location ($30K/mo, 9,500 sqft). Grew to 50 local + 50 Philippines. Making millions in 8 months.

**28. Times Square billboard:** PR company got him on the TSX electronic billboard. Part of his success/brand building.

**29. Forbes article:** They came to HIM in 2021 — found his YouTube/Instagram. He was the only one publishing and teaching Airbnb with great success. After he made the model easy to understand, everyone copied. Copycats used "high revenue" model (e.g., Destin Florida — insane summers but lose money 9 months). Chi Ta had consistent numbers, $3K/month profit.

## 📣 THE FUNNEL

**30. Current client source:** ALL from Midas Wealth (financial wealth management firm, teaches cost segregation). Chi Ta is their STR expert. ONLY income source. If Midas dries up (which it has recently), he makes no money. THIS IS WHY THE FUNNEL IS CRITICAL.

**31. Video content:** Tons on YouTube and Instagram. Lots of raw/unedited. Needs a way to piece it together (can't watch video, but can work with transcripts).

**32. Paid ads history:** Yes, 4 years of FB/IG ads + Instagram shoutouts. $10M revenue over time, $2-4M profit. But too many copycats — ads no longer profitable. Low ROAS. Managing sales team was dreadful. Quit teaching because of it.

**33. Weekly Q&A/webinar:** "Yes I am open to anything that will make money."

**34-35:** (Not answered — testimonial videos + close rate)
